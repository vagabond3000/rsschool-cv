## About me

Hello!

I'm a Front-end Developer with the main goal of starting my career and getting a junior position job. I successfully completed the course "Website Development with HTML, CSS & JavaScript" from IT-Academy and am currently looking for an internship/training in the same scope. I continue to study JavaScript on my own as well as with Rolling Scopes School.
I have an excellent knowledge of OOP and software development methodologies and I want to put my knowledge into practice. I’m also familiar with Git, since I use Github for my studies.
3rd year student of Minsk State Linguistic University; correspondence department, which means I am looking for a full time job (студентка заочного обучения, рассматриваю полную занятость).

My career-switch experience has taught me to realize how to learn and apply new paradigms quickly and efficiently. It has also allowed me to develop a flexible approach to work and life.

I would love to be part of your team!
